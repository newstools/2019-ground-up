Contract workers employed by the eThekwini Municipality’s solid waste department marched in Durban’s city centre on Thursday. They are demanding to be permanently employed by the municipality. Dozens of people marched from King Dinuzulu Park to the City Hall to hand over a memorandum. One of the protest organisers, Dennis Mthalane, said that he was one of many employees who had worked for the municipality for years but was not permanent. He has been working for nearly six years. “We are fighting unfairness that is taking place within the municipality. We all want to be given permanent jobs because it is clear that the municipality has the money. It can employ all of us permanently,” said Mthalane. Bongani Hlophe, from the mayor’s office accepted the memorandum. She said they had already met with union representatives on Wednesday to address some of the workers’ concerns.
