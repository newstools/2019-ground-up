Stink. This is what residents living in a neighbourhood in Umlazi, Durban, have to live with because of a burst drain that has not been fixed for weeks. The burst is near the Lindani Driving School on Sibusiso Mdakane Drive in V Section of the township. It is a few metres away from people’s homes. Besides the odour and having to risk being hit by speeding cars as they try to avoid walking in the stagnant water on the pedestrian pavement, residents are also worried the burst drain is a health hazard. People we spoke said the drain burst during the heavy rains three weeks ago. They claimed they reported it immediately to the ward councillor’s office as well as the eThekwini Municipality. Zandi Mnguni said the smell is unbearable. “My house is a few metres from the sewerage. We can actually smell it in the comfort of our homes.” She said flies have since increasingly been visiting their houses. “We are surprised when we see weeks passing by without it being fixed,” she said. EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said that the delay was because of the many problems reported by residents to the City. “The issue has been noted and a team will be sent to investigate. They can follow up on the matter by calling the relevant department and quoting their reference number. A call centre agent will advise them on the status of their complaint. We apologise for the delay,” said Mayisela. Ward councillor Robert Mzobe denied that the matter was brought to his attention. But he conceded that it may have been reported to his office.
