About 40 Vrygrond residents protested outside Muizenberg Magistrates Court on Thursday, demanding that four of their leaders who were arrested during a protest on 29 September be released. They sang outside the court and held placards that read, “Release our leaders”. The four men were arrested during a protest against the demolition by law enforcement officials of their shacks in Xakabantu. The protesters also demanded a solution to the transport problem between Vrygrond and the Blue Route Mall in Tokai. At present taxis from Vrygrond are not allowed to park at the Mall and the protesters wanted the City of Cape Town to facilitate dialogue between mall management and the Vrygrond Development Forum. Ncebisi Mphola, Isaac Goliat, Bonginkosi Mabala and Vuyo Mthini were charged with public violence. Isaacs was not granted bail because of previous arrests but the others were granted R500 bail. The matter was postponed to 26 November for further investigation by magistrate Crystal McKenna.
