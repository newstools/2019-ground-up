 UNISA students protested at the Pietermaritzburg campus as part of a regional shut down of UNISA campuses in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday morning. They blockaded Pine Street and Langalibalele Street with burning tyres, garbage and rocks. A Department of Education vehicle was stoned. Police used rubber bullets to disperse the protesters. Lieutenant Thulani Zwane of the KZN police media centre said a case of public violence was opened. Sihle Khwela, secretary of the South African Students Congress (SASCO) for the Umgungundlovu region, said exam results changed inexplicably. “The first time I checked, I had passed with 79%. On the following day when I checked, there was 7%. Many students are experiencing that problem with the results … We want our scripts given [back] to us. Students must verify the results for themselves.” He complained that exam dates were set making it impossible for students to write. “The exam dates should commence once the registration is finished. A student can’t write an exam before registering,” said Khwela. Zama Khumalo, studying for a BA, said her mark for accounting went from 80% to 14%. “How is that possible?” she asked. UNISA’s KZN communication and marketing manager Siyabonga Seme said most of its campuses were disrupted by student protests. “The meetings between the management and students’ leadership are ongoing since last week when the protests began.”
