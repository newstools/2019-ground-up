 The City of Cape Town’s human settlements department has announced that there are still places available for affordable housing opportunities in Blue Downs. This follows council’s recent approval for the transfer of 219 residential serviced plots in Blue Downs Fairdale for Gap housing opportunities for qualifying beneficiaries. Mayoral Committee Member for Human Settlements Malusi Booi said, the purchase prices will be based on a sliding scale of discounted rates, depending on the qualifying beneficiary’s monthly income. This means that properties could be sold to the beneficiaries for between R25,000 and R63,000. The plots range between 160m2 and 350m2 and are market valued at approximately R105,000. “The sale will be secured once a bank loan is approved and the full payment is made to the transferring attorney within six months of signing the deed of sale. “Furthermore, the deed of sale will include conditions that no informal dwellings can be built on the property and that the property cannot be sold within the first five years, from the date that it is purchased from the City,” said Booi. Some of the requirements needed to qualify for the housing opportunities include that the residents are on the City’s Housing Database, have not previously benefited from a government subsidy, and have a monthly income of between R9,000 and R22,000. Many people have been on waiting lists for decades, and GroundUp frequently receives allegations of corruption in the allocation of houses. GroundUp has compiled an information sheet on the various housing policies and opportunities.
