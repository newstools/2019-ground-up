 A veld fire, fanned by a howling westerly wind, came within metres of Rhodes University Upper Campus on Tuesday night. Student residences had to be evacuated. The fire cut out the power for the whole of campus and parts of Makhanda West. Elana Chrimbo, a warden at one of the residences, said that initially emergency services didnâ€™t think the fire would threaten the university. Then it changed direction and started burning the bamboo just 20 metres from the Guy Butler residence. Ambulances treated three people for smoke inhalation. Rhodes University and St Andrews and DSG schools sent water tankers and workers to assist the Makana fire fighters fight the blaze. Water is a scarce resource in Makhanda following extended periods of drought and severely degraded water infrastructure. At about 8:30pm, Makana firefighters reported that the fire was under control and that no damage had been done to any properties. Students, whose residents were evacuated, were given mattresses and blankets to sleep at assigned residences that were a safe distance from the fire. They were told that they could only go back to their residences in the morning. The fire is believed to have started on Tuesday afternoon at about 4pm by an electrical short circuit at the Old Power station near the industrial side of Makhanda. We will update this article as soon as the municipality responds.
