Learners at Waterval High school and their parents shut down the school on Tuesday, demanding that the Limpopo Department of Education fix the school’s infrastructure. Rivoni School for the Blind was closed down during a protest about the same issues yesterday. The road leading to Waterval High was closed by stones and branches. “This is not the first time we have alerted the Limpopo Department of Education to renovate the classrooms and the toilets,” said Gladys Maluleke, the chair of the School Governing Board. “Last year we had a meeting with the department, they promised they would do the renovations but up to now nothing has been done.” “We wrote and called the department requesting them to come and fix the broken infrastructure but no-one has come to our help,” she said. Spokesperson for the department, Sam Makondo, said the department gave schools funds of which a percentage was meant for maintenance and the repair of ceilings, doors, windows, and toilets. “The department builds schools and toilets and we expect schools to maintain,” Makondo said. The roof of one classroom is broken. The boys’ toilet is not working and taps in the toilets are dry. Parents say they are now prepared to fight the department till the renovations are done. “If the government does not give us a positive response then learners are not going to resume classes anytime soon,” said Robert Ngobeni, whose two children are at the school. “I think it’s time we showed the government that we need renovations at this school,” said a grade 12 learner. “At times I have to hold on for the toilet till 2pm until I get home.”
