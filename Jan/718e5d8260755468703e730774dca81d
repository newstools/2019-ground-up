Learners from eight primary schools in or near Bonteheuwel showed off their athletic skills on Thursday. The participating schools were: Cedar Primary, Montevideo Primary, Rosewood Primary, Mimosa Primary, Bergsig Primary, E.A. Janari Primary, Arcadia Primary and Montana Primary. Usually in the news because of gang violence, these photos by Masixole Feni show a different, happier and more hopeful side to Bonteheuwel. The event took place at Blue Downs Sports Stadium, about 20km from Bonteheuwel. Vygieskraal Stadium was unavailable and Athlone Stadium doesnâ€™t have a running track, even though they are both close to Bonteheuwel.  Keano Hendricks, 11, from Montana Primary throws the javelin.  Shaakira Solomons, 10, from Arcadia Primary does high jump.  Lutho Ghaba, 9, from Rosewood Primary throws the discus.  Sivenathi Gaba, 9, from Montevideo Primary gets ready to throw the shot put.  Avethandwa Benile, 9, from E.A. Janari launches the shot put.  Marvin Iyambi, 9, from Montana does the long jump.  Razia Boltman and other learners from Arcadia Primary cheer for their school mates.
