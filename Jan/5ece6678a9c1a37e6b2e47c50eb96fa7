When a project to build latrines got underway in Manzana village, Newcastle, in October last year, residents looked forward to proper toilets to give them dignity. But some of the villagers are still waiting for their toilets. Pit toilets have been provided for 35 households but 15 others are incomplete. Holes have been dug and left uncovered, prompting fears of accidents. Meanwhile residents are continuing to use their makeshift toilets. Sibongile Mthethwa, 60, is gradually losing hope that the new toilets will ever be completed. “Some of the homes nearby have had their toilets erected and completed, but I’m one of those unlucky ones who are still waiting. The contract workers dug holes and left concrete slabs on the ground, and told us that the material was in short supply, so they couldn’t continue with the work.” The uncovered holes are a danger to young children especially after rain, says Thobile Xaba, a mother of a two-year-old son. She says contractors promised to complete the work in January but had not come. Ward councillor Vukile Kubheka said the contractor had halted the work because of a shortage of materials. “Hopefully the project will be completed in the near future, probably not before March,” said Kubheka, who did not explain why there had been a shortage of materials or provide the name of the contractor.
