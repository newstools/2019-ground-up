Dogs are popular in Mfuleni township in Cape Town, but at least one resident has befriended more unusual pets. Mavusi Qola is a traditional healer, with a reputation in the community for being friendly and reasonable. He looks after a variety of animals, including a dog, a tortoise, an owl and a rooster.

While many of the township dogs are strays, lots of boys keep dogs as pets.  Khayone Maneli plays with his ten-week old puppy, Bruno.  Cats are less popular than dogs, but Masixole Gqatsiwe says he likes his four-month old kitten. “It keeps the mice away.”  Two dogs scan the outside world from the safety of their home in Mfuleni.
